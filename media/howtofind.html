    <p>Depending on what you are looking for, choose one of three starting
    places:</p>
    <ol>
       <li class="gtxt">
         Usually, you just want to find somebody, so use 'FIND'. Type in
         as much of their first (or last) name as you can remember. Upper
         or lower case does not matter. 'Jon' will get you 'J. Jones' and
         'Joni Kletter', among others. If you are not too specific (like
         'Xingtao') you'll get a listing of names within buttons. If you
         find the name you are looking for, just click on the
         button. Otherwise try again.
       </li>
       <li class="gtxt">
         If you've got two or three minutes to spare, you could fetch the
         entire Membership Directory. There is usually very little
         advantage in doing this unless you are almost completely at a
         lost on how to spell a person's name. From that rather long
         listing, click on individual names to get the complete details.
       </li>
       <li class="gtxt">
         The Pet Directory contains listings of creatures (mainly dogs)
         that own members. If you have a critter name or some FIDO dog tag
         identifying a critter, start there.), The Pet Directory lists
         associated members(s) with each pet; click on the member's name
         to get whatever contact information the database has on that
         person.), Just remember: we promise to keep ALL member
         information confidential. Please do not use this data for
         non-FIDO business or give this information to anyone who is not
         working on a FIDO project. Please protect your password to this
         web site. FIDO does not condone email spamming in any form; use
         the email links here sparingly and write to our members in a
         friendly way, as if their friendship matters, because it does.
