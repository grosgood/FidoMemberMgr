Sort members into cohorts, defaulting to 90 days, based on the period in days to their membership term expiration, for positive cohorts, or days since their terms expired, for negative cohorts. Depict the cohorts as elements of a bar chart. Red elements depict inactive members, green active. For 90 day cohorts, the default, a pale green and pale red bar depicts expiring and expired member classes. Cohorts are with respect to the date when the chart is compiled and constitutes the zero reference day.
